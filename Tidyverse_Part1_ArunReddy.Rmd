### Introduction {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset.-pills}

![Tidyverse Packages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataScienceAR/Cuny-Assignments/master/Data-607/Images/tidyverse%20packages.jpg)

"Using one or more TidyVerse packages, and any dataset from fivethirtyeight.com or Kaggle, create a programming sample "vignette" that demonstrates how to use one or more of the capabilities of the selected TidyVerse package with your selected dataset."

The tidyverse package we will be using here is dplyr

Overview of dplyr

"dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges:

mutate() adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
select() picks variables based on their names.
filter() picks cases based on their values.
summarise() reduces multiple values down to a single summary.
arrange() changes the ordering of the rows."

***
#### R Packages Used

This assignment was accomplished by utilizing these packages for both data analysis and visualizations.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}


library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)



```

### Data & the dplyr {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

#### Importing the data

The Google play store dataset used is retrived from kaggle Dataset.

"While many public datasets (on Kaggle and the like) provide Apple App Store data, there are not many counterpart datasets available for Google Play Store apps anywhere on the web."

```{r, warning=FALSE}
StoreApps <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataScienceAR/Cuny-Assignments/master/Data-607/Data-Sets/googleplaystore.csv")
```



```{r}
tibble(StoreApps)
```


#### Data manipulation with dplyr

Steps involved in data manipulations are

1. Selecting the desired columns with "select" function
2. Filtering the rows with "filter"
3. Group the data based on Genre

```{r}

clean_set<-StoreApps %>% 
  select(Rating,Reviews,Genres) %>%  # Filtering the columns
  filter(Rating>=4.7) %>%                 # Filtering the rows for Rating equal or above 4.7
  group_by(Genres,Rating) %>% 
  summarise(Average_Reviews=mean(Reviews))
        

kable(clean_set) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

```
